# Java_FileTracking

Write a program to monitor the changes in a remote directory on computers. The student needs to write two programs: a client program to run on the monitored machines and a server program to run on the monitoring machine.

Client Program:
Connects to the server and exchanges information.
Server Program:
Manages a list of clients.
Selects the client to monitor and selects the directory on the client machine to monitor.
Notifies the user (at the server) of any changes made to this directory (deleting/adding subdirectories, deleting/adding/editing files within the directory).
Can monitor multiple clients simultaneously (each client monitors only one directory).
Provides a graphical user interface.
